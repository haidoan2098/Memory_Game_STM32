# MEMORY GAME USING STM32F103C8T6

## Describe
Players will have to focus on accurately memorizing the LED sequence displayed by the system. After each successful memorization, the length of the sequence will increase, making the challenge increasingly difficult. Get ready, because each round is a step forward in the race to test your memory and concentration!

## Note
When using my project, it is necessary to connect the libraries in "MyLib" with the Compiler.
